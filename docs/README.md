## Mod description
A mod plays sound when `StyleHUD.AscendRank` and `StyleHUD.ComboStart` is called

`added two preset announcer greythroat & irene as template for editing`

`tbh both of them is just my personal favor so it's best to make your own one`

considering huge performance issue, it's best to set `Logging.Console.Enabled` to `false` in `ULTRAKILL\BepInEx\config\BepInEx.cfg`

## How to install it
1. [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/ultrakill/p/ebkr/r2modman/)
   - IDK I never used it but I think just click download and that's it
   
<br>

2. [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/c/ultrakill/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/) (Manual Installation)
   - Extract all contents from the `.zip` file into the **ULTRAKILL\BepInEx\plugin** folder.


## How to config it
`PluginConfigurator => GreyAnnouncer => RankAnnouncer => Edit Externally(yeah a Lazer feat) => Edit(add audio etc.) => back to Main setting => Reload`

`But tbh you can create a new one by copy config.ini`

you can switch between different presets
