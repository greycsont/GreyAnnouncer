This project is generally licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later.
However, to encourage wider adoption and interoperability, the following exception applies:

        Code that only uses the public interfaces (e.g., via GreyAnnouncer.AnnouncerClass or other
        officially documented APIs) is *not* considered a derivative *work* under the AGPL.

        These public interfaces are instead licensed under the terms of the PostgreSQL License,
        allowing integration into software under other licenses, including proprietary ones.

Modifications to the core framework, internal implementation, or any behavior not accessed
via the public API remain fully subject to the AGPL-3.0-or-later license.
