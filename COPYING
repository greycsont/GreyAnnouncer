        SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later
        With an explicit exception for local plugins and static API usage.

This project is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later,
with the following exception:

        Code that interacts solely through the officially documented public APIs (e.g.,
        via GreyAnnouncer.AnnouncerClass), whether through static linking or dynamic plugins,
        is *not considered a derivative work* and may be used under:

                SPDX-License-Identifier: PostgreSQL

        The term "Public API" refers specifically to the interfaces, classes, variables, functions, etc.,
        that are publicly documented and explicitly exposed for direct interaction.

        In addition, code that accesses internal members via reflection or similar mechanisms
        *for the purpose of reading or writing data* (e.g., modifying configuration values, observing internal state)
        is also permitted under this exception, provided that:

        - No new executable logic is injected into the core system (e.g., no method patching, IL rewriting, or code hooking).
        - Such reflective access does not replace or override existing logic, only extends or configures it.

        Code that performs runtime method injection, behavioral patching, or otherwise alters the
        control flow of the core software *is considered a derivative work* and must comply with the AGPL-3.0-or-later.


However, any deployment of this software as a networked service (such as SaaS or
remote interaction) *must comply with AGPL Section 13*, requiring the complete
Corresponding Source to be made available to all users of the service.

Modifications to the core framework, including internal components not accessed through
the defined Public APIs, are fully subject to the AGPL-3.0-or-later license.
