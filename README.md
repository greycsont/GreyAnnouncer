## What does it do?
It will play a sound when you reach to a higher style rank!

You can add the sound by replace the .wav file in the **Audio** folder near the plugin!

## How to install it
1. [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/ultrakill/p/ebkr/r2modman/)
   > But I'm not sure does it work or not because I never uses it

2. [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/c/ultrakill/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/) (Manual Installation)

   1. Install **BepInEx**.
   2. Download the mod.
   3. Extract all contents from the `.zip` file into the game folder.
      - **Highly recommended**: Create and name a separate folder inside the `plugins` directory to keep mods organized.


### How to add the rank sound
1. Find the **audio** folder near the plugin.

2. Open the **audio** folder.

3. Add the sound you wanted to the folder ( The file format only accept the **.wav** format )

4. The rank sound file's name should rename to the specific format, include: **D C B A S SS SSS U**

#### Rank Sound File Naming Convention

The rank sound files should be named in the following specific format:

- `D.wav`
- `C.wav`
- `B.wav`
- `A.wav`
- `S.wav`
- `SS.wav`
- `SSS.wav`
- `U.wav`

Ensure that all rank sound files follow this naming convention for proper recognition.

If a required sound file is missing, the system will:
- **Skip playback** for that rank.
- **Not affect other rank sounds** that are correctly configured.

### How to customize the setting
There's two ways to customize the setting

1. Download and Using [PluginConfigurator](https://thunderstore.io/c/ultrakill/p/EternalsTeam/PluginConfigurator/) to edit in-game.

2. Find the **greycsont.ultrakill.GreyAnnouncer.cfg** file in the **ULTRAKILL/Beplnex/config** folder, then open and edit it manually.
