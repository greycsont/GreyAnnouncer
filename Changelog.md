### v0.1.5
-Fixed the bug that will crash the mod if without all the audio required.

-Sorry for the 94 person who downloaded the mod.

### v0.1.6
-Discarded the config.ini reader, instead using the BepInEx's official config.bind() method. ( I've always seen the BepInEx as BeplnEx (lowercase L)). I used to using config.ini as the configuration file because I've seen this in a other mod called NGS2Black create by Fiend_Busa. But BepInEx have a official API, so why not?

-Added MIT Lisence.
